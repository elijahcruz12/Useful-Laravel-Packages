# Useful Laravel Packages

In this repository, we list useful packages that can be integrated with laravel.In


**Please note that we will not accept any spam PR's and will report them. The only way a PR is to be added is if it genuinly is a good pull request. However, we do usually recommend doing one package per PR, to be able to review them better.**

## How to use

To better allow you to find packages, we have sorted them based on the language they are primarily created in. This is to ensure that each package is not duplicated into multiple folder. For example, Bootstrap is primarily a CSS language, although it does contain some JavaScript, it has more CSS than JS. As such, it should be placed in the CSS folder.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute a package, please open an issue **FIRST** before doing a PR. This is to ensure that you are the only one working on a package. We have added an issue template to make things easier. If a package should be updated, than please be open an issue for that as well. Please note that a PR will be denied if it does not have an issue open for it.

We have created a ``template.md`` file, to allow you to have a starting point for a packages markdown listing.

If a package is on packagist, npm, or something similar, please include a badge to display it's latest version.

Like we have said in the top, please do not open spam pull requests, as it just wastes everyone's time.
